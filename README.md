## Important Note About WhatsApp Integration

This application currently uses WhatsApp integration as a test feature. For a production environment, it is recommended to use a professional messaging service provider such as Twilio or similar services that offer:

- Reliable message delivery
- Better scalability
- Professional support
- Compliance with messaging regulations
- Analytics and monitoring capabilities

These services typically require a paid subscription but provide the necessary infrastructure for production-grade applications.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

## Development

The project uses ESLint for code quality and TypeScript for type safety. The configuration is set up to provide a good balance between strict type checking and development convenience.

## Building for Production
